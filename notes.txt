Basics:
    Simplicity
        Everything is a value (No reference types)
        No classes (Only struct)
        Only One loop construct
        Compilation restrictions
            Unused variables are not allowed (at function scope)
        Cross platform Compilation
        
        No exceptions (ONLY errors)
            No try catch finally block support

        Functions
            Anonymous functions
            Higher Order functions
            deferred functions

Data Types

    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real [float32] + imaginary [float32])
    complex128 (real [float64] + imaginary [float64])

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (unicode character code point)
    
Concurrency
    - Never assume the time taken for a goroutine to execute
    - Never assume the sequence of execution of the goroutines

    Channel
        - A receive operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation
        - A send operation is blocked until a receive operation is initialized (non-buffered channel)
        - A send operation is NOT blocked if the buffer is not full (buffered channel)
